# Break Through Tech AI

During an 8 week stint at the Break Through Tech AI program at Cornell Tech, I had the opportunity to learn and implement many machine learning models. 

After much practice on the **pre-processing** stage, developing my Python skills, including using Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, I begun learning simple models such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees. I developed techniques to find the ideal hyperparameters for each model by analyzing various evaluation metrics.

I then learned about more complex models such as ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees), using the stacking, bagging, and boosting techniques.

Finally, I delved into Natural Language Processing and neural networks, which meant I could finally build more complex and non-linear models. I learned to train train, finetune, and test data pipelines and build neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.
