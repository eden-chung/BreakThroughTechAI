# Break Through Tech AI

During an intensive 8-week course at the Break Through Tech AI program at Cornell Tech, I had the opportunity to learn and implement many machine learning models. 

After much practice on the **pre-processing** stage, developing my Python skills, including using Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, I began learning simple, but powerful models such as linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees. I developed techniques to find the ideal hyperparameters for each model by analyzing various evaluation metrics.

I then learned about more complex models such as ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees), using the stacking, bagging, and boosting techniques.

Finally, I delved into Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks, which meant I could finally build more complex and non-linear models. I learned to train train, finetune, and test data pipelines and build neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.

I am proud to present the work I completed during this program and I am excited to continue to apply my skills to real-world projects in AI and ML!
